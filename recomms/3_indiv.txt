Regular monitoring of one's health is extremely important. Extreme caution should be taken when interacting in public places. Proper hygeine (hand washing, covering sneezes/coughs, etc.) should be practiced regularly. Ensure that the household is cleaned and disinfected regularly to prevent the spread of diseases among members. If sick, determine based on severity of symptoms if it can be managed at home or at a healthcare facility.
